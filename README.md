What user stories are completed in this iteration?
  Created an intro message that explains what the randompassword program does
  We successfully added a place for for user to input desired password length
  Generate a random password based off of what the users inputs
  Implemented a way for the users to indicate if they want any specific characters in the password
  We added an input check for the arguments

What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
Need a place for them to add how many capital letters are required


Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
  no  

What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
  The current command is giving a number for the length of the password and optionally adding any required charachters. For example if you want a password length of 8 you would type: java randomPassword.passwordGenerator 8
  if you wanted a password of length 9 and contained "!" you would type java randomPassword.passwordGenerator 9 !
  There is also a supplementary command "help" that prints out a useful message on how to run the program properly.
  Important: Make sure after compiling to run the program from the class folder and not where the java file is. (Run from the src folder)

  Finally, we have also included a script that runs a couple of these commands
