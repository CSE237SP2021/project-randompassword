# cse237-project
What user stories were completed this iteration?
  Created an intro message that explains what the randompassword program does
  We successfully added a place for for user to input desired password length
  Generate a random password based off of what the users inputs

What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
  We need to implement a place for users to add their desired characters in the password
  Need a place for them to add how many capital letters are required
  We need to implement an input check for the arguments

Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
  no  

What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
  right now the only command is giving a number for the length of the password. For example if you want a password length of 8 you would type: java randomPassword.passwordGenerator 8
